# key-value-store
This is the course project of [Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing?specialization=cloud-computing) and [Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cloud-computing-2?specialization=cloud-computing) in coursera.

The [membership-protocol](./membership-protocol) is used to maintain the membership list of a cluster of servers. This mebership protocol is also used as the underlying component in the [key-value-store](./key-value-store), which implements a basic distributed NoSQL database with simple CRUD functions. 
The implementation passed all the testcases provided. However, it is still a coarse implementation so far, so there are a lot of ways to improve it.
